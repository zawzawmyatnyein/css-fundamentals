# CSS Layouts

## Three ways of building layouts with CSS
- Float
- Flexbox
- Grid

<br>

### Float
- See the [official docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) to learn more about floats

<br>

### Flexbox
- One-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns
- Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces
- Flexbox solves common problems such as **vertical centering** and creating **equal-height columns**
- Flexbox is perfect for **replacing floats**, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code

### The flex model

- **Main axis**: the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in
- The start and end of this axis are called the **main start** and **main end**.
- **Cross axis**: the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in
- The start and end of this axis are called the **cross start** and **cross end**.
- **Flex container**: the parent element that has  `display: flex` set on it
- **Flex items**: the items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container

- Has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.
